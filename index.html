        This document details the process to prepare an <b>AGILOX OCF</b> for operation after delivery of the vehicle. This process is currently considered a "work in progress" and is subject to change. Please contact <b>AGILOX North America, Inc.</b> customer support with any questions or issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>AGILOX OCF</b> (Omni-directional Counterbalance Forklift) is the newest product developed by <b>AGILOX Services GmbH</b>, and is the successor to the company's flagship product, the <b>AGILOX ONE</b>. The OCF is an intelligently-guided, autonomous vehicle that resembles a traditional forklift in appearance and operation, and is meant to be the solution to many tasks that are ill-suited for the ONE.

      <p>
        The OCF is delivered on a wooden pallet combined with metal supports, plywood walls and a plywood lid protecting the body of the vehicle. There is a secondary smaller wooden box fixed to the plywood lid which protects the LiDAR navigation sensor from damage during transport. The mast of the vehicle protrudes from an opening in the plywood lid and is protected by plastic packaging material. The order of disassembly for the crate should be as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Detach the smaller wooden box protecting the LiDAR using a drill and #20 torx bit. Carefully lift the wooden box upwards, making sure to not damage the LiDAR sensor underneath, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Detach the top plywood lid using a drill and #30 torx bit to remove any wood screws securing the lid to the plywood walls. Once it is free from the rest of the crate, use a forklift or other lifting mechanism to <i>carefully</i> lift the lid upwards until it clears the mast. The cutout should be wide enough to fit around the mast as long as the smaller wooden box was removed in the previous step. Set the lid aside once it has been successfully removed.</li>
        <li>Detach the front and rear plywood walls using a drill and #30 torx bit to remove any visible wood screws securing the walls in place. Some screws securing these walls may be on the outer edges of the left and right walls as well. Once all screws have been removed, carefully slide the walls out and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Detach the left and right plywood walls using a drill and #30 torx bit, Most screws may have been removed when detaching the front and rear walls, but check to make sure any weren't missed along the bottom of the walls, securing them to the pallet. Set aside once removed.</li>
        <li>Inside the crate, you should find packaging containing body panels that have yet to be installed on the vehicle, the hoisting chain and eyelets used to raise the vehicle, and bolts used to install the forks on the vehicle. Please set these to the side for now.</li>
        <li>Inside the crate, you should also find the forks that have yet to be installed on the vehicle. Remove the metal straps securing the forks to the pallet using a drill and #20 torx bit. Set the forks aside for now. <br>
          <i>Note: The forks themselves are quite heavy and require at least two people to move one at a time, or they can be lifted and moved aside with a forklift or other lifting mechanism.</i>
        </li>
        <li>Remove the plastic packaging material from the body and mast of the vehicle. If using a box-cutter or knife to cut the material away, be careful not to accidentally damage any exposed wiring on the vehicle. A bed of plastic packaging material will be trapped underneath the vehicle, the rest can be torn or cut away from this section of material.</li>
        <li>The OCF is secured to the bottom pallet with three hot pink metal brackets.
          <ul>
            <li>One bracket on the lower front of the vehicle</li>
            <li>Two brackets inside the middle cavity of the vehicle</li>
          </ul>
          The brackets can be removed with a combination of large hex wrenches, socket wrenchs and/or crescent wrenches <i>(more details coming soon)</i>.
        </li>
        <li>The OCF should now be free from the pallet and ready to be lifted and set on the ground. But there are a few things we need to do first:
          <ul>
            <li>Remove the top grey cover from the body of the OCF by prying it up on each side of the mast and at the very front of the vehicle. Set aside for now. Be careful not to damage any wiring underneath.</li>
            <li>Attach the three eyelets that came with the included hoisting chain to the designated threaded inserts. The inserts can be located by the blue stickers with a hook icon. There should be one underneath the mast, and two in the upper middle of the vehicle underneath the cover that was just removed. The red eyelet goes in the center underneath the mast. The two pink eyelets go on either side, and use the pin attachment to tightly secure the eyelet inside the threaded insert.</li>
            <li>Attach the hoisting chain hooks to each of the eyelets and verify everything is secure</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Using a forklift, crane, or other lifting mechanism capable of safely lifting more than 8000lbs, attach the lifting mechanism to the hoisiting chain and slowly lift the OCF off of the wooden pallet and onto a smooth, flat section of suitable floor space. Detach the hoisting chain from the lifting mechanism, then remove the chain and eyelets from the body of the OCF. Congratulations! The OCF has been successfully unpackaged and is now ready for assembly.</li>

          Assembly
        </h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Before the OCF is ready for operation, all parts must be attached and secured in place to prevent any process errors or failures from occuring. The parts that have yet to be attached should be:
      <ol>
        <li>Top cover</li>
        <li>Body panels</li>
        <li>Forks</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>
        Top Cover
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before returning the top cover to the vehicle, you will need to turn on the main power switch for the battery. The battery housing is a black metal box located in the middle of the OC's body just below the middle hoisting point that you used when lifting the vehicle. You will find a main power switch at the top of the battery housing. Using the small flathead screwdriver, turn this switch to the "on" position. The top cover is now ready to be returned to the OC. Be sure to connect the two wiring harnesses on the underside of the top cover to their corresponding wiring harnesses located on the vehicle near the battery housing. The top cover should snap in at two rear points on either side of the mast as well as at the very front of the OC.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Body Panels
      </h2>
      <p>
        The lower left, right, and front-center body panels need to be installed to protect the internal cavity and any exposed wiring from potential debris and damage. The left and right panels snap into place using the same method as the top cover. The front panel must be installed using a panel key, similar to the front panel on the AGILOX ONE.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Forks
      </h2>
      <p>
        Finally, the forks must be installed on the mounting plate at the rear of the vehicle. The forks themselves are quite heavy and it is highly recommended to use a lifting mechanism to bring them to the appropriate height for mounting (an AGILOX ONE in manual mode is fully capable of lifting the forks to the desired height). <b>Do not use the bolts to begin attaching the forks to the mounting plate just yet!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a cavity in rear of the vertical arm of each fork which houses two wiring connectors. These must be connected to their corresponding connectors on the mounting plate. Use the labeling on the connectors to determine which is the left and right fork and use the provided slack to make the connections before securing the forks to the mounting plate. The connectors and the extra slack can be stored inside the cavity on the forks. <i>Note: to be sure the left and right forks are in the correct position, make sure the sensors located at the base of the forks (in the 90 degree elbow) are on the inside of each fork, not the outside.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once these connections have been made, the forks can be secured to the mounting plate using the provided bolts, a torque wrench set to 80ft/lbs, and a 9mm hex key attachment. There are 12 long bolts and 2 short bolts per fork. The 12 long bolts are divided between the 6 upper and 6 lower mounting points on the vertical arm of the fork, and the 2 short bolts are secured in the 2 central mounting points on the vertical arm of the fork. It is recommended to use an extension on the wrench to help feed the 2 shorter bolts into the cavity of the fork. Once all bolts have been tightened appropriately, the lifting mechanism holding the forks in place can be removed and assembly should be complete.

      <p>
        Now that the OCF is fully assembled, make sure the mode selector is set to maintenance mode (the key should be turned to the left-most position) and power on the vehicle. Connect your device to the vehicle's hotspot and navigate to the HMI. <i>Note: If you are unfamiliar with this process, please refer to the Operation Manual for the AGILOX OCF or AGILOX ONE.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few settings that must be applied in order for the OCF to begin working autonomously:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, you can go ahead and perform the preliminary setup (connecting the OCF to an existing union, WiFi, etc.), please refer to the Operation Manual if you need help with these steps.</li>
        <li>The weight of the forks must be calibrated. By default, the weight of the forks themselves is being measured by the vehicle and the load weight will be reading 30-40kg, this will trigger an occupation error and prevent the OCF from driving in automatic mode.</li>
        <li>The zero position of the forks must be set. This process as well as the process for calibrating the weight of the forks is detailed in section 3.2 of the Administrator Manual. Once both these processes are complete, you can turn the mode selector to manual mode and perform the final task while connected to the vehicle over WiFi.</li>
        <li>The lowered fork height must be set above the height of the rear SICK safety sensor, otherwise the forks will trigger the protective field. The object <code>"lift": { "lowered": 200, "default": 250 }</code> can be placed in the "localconfig" collection in the system database editor if the OCF is part of a union with AGILOX ONE units and you don't want to alter the lowered lift value of the entire union. The values of "200" and "250" can be adjusted, as long as the forks are not within the protective field.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once all these tasks are complete, the OCF should be ready to receive orders and begin working autonomously.
